     * Title:        Calc Count Record
     * Description:  Specifies the maximum times the gui should perform a formula
     *               recalculation.  For instance: in the case a formula includes
     *               cells that are themselves a result of a formula and a value
     *               Changes.  This Is essentially a failsafe against an infinate
     *               loop in the event the formulas are not independant.
