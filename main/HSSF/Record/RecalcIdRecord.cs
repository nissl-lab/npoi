     * Title: Recalc Id Record
     * Description:  This record Contains an ID that marks when a worksheet was last
     *               recalculated. It's an optimization Excel uses to determine if it
     *               needs to  recalculate the spReadsheet when it's opened. So far, only
     *               the two values <c>0xC1 0x01 0x00 0x00 0x80 0x38 0x01 0x00</c>
     *               (do not recalculate) and <c>0xC1 0x01 0x00 0x00 0x60 0x69 0x01
     *               0x00</c> have been seen. If the field <c>isNeeded</c> Is
     *               Set to false (default), then this record Is swallowed during the
     *               serialization Process
     * REFERENCE:  http://chicago.sourceforge.net/devel/docs/excel/biff8.html
