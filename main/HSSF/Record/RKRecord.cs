     * Title:        RK Record
     * Description:  An internal 32 bit number with the two most significant bits
     *               storing the type.  This is part of a bizarre scheme to save disk
     *               space and memory (gee look at all the other whole records that
     *               are in the file just "cause"..,far better to waste Processor
     *               cycles on this then leave on of those "valuable" records out).
     * We support this in Read-ONLY mode.  HSSF Converts these to NUMBER records
     *
