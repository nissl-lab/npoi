     * Title: Protect Record
     * Description:  defines whether a sheet or workbook is protected (HSSF DOES NOT SUPPORT ENCRYPTION)
     * (kindly ask the US government to stop having arcane stupid encryption laws and we'll support it) 
     * (after all terrorists will all use US-legal encrypton right??)
     * HSSF now supports the simple "protected" sheets (where they are not encrypted and open office et al
     * ignore the password record entirely).
