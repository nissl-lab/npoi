    /**
     * Table of strings shared across all sheets in a workbook.
     * <p>
     * A workbook may contain thousands of cells Containing string (non-numeric) data. Furthermore this data is very
     * likely to be repeated across many rows or columns. The goal of implementing a single string table that is shared
     * across the workbook is to improve performance in opening and saving the file by only Reading and writing the
     * repetitive information once.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Consider for example a workbook summarizing information for cities within various countries. There may be a
     * column for the name of the country, a column for the name of each city in that country, and a column
     * Containing the data for each city. In this case the country name is repetitive, being duplicated in many cells.
     * In many cases the repetition is extensive, and a tremendous savings is realized by making use of a shared string
     * table when saving the workbook. When displaying text in the spreadsheet, the cell table will just contain an
     * index into the string table as the value of a cell, instead of the full string.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The shared string table Contains all the necessary information for displaying the string: the text, formatting
     * properties, and phonetic properties (for East Asian languages).
     * </p>
